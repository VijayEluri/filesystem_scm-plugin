# About
This is the source repository for the **File System SCM** plugin for Jenkins.
This plugin provides an additional SCM option to Jenkins, based on the file
system.

For more information see the [wiki].

# Purpose and Use Cases

Use this plugin if you want to use the Jenkins SCM (source code management)
functionality, but instead of retrieving code from a version control system such
as CVS, Subversion or git, instead retrieve the code from a directory on the
file system.

A typical use case is: during development of a Jenkins job (e.g. a pipeline),
you don't need/want to connect to an actual version control system, but avoid
the latency by just getting things from the local file system.
